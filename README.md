# FightForFreedom---Project
Set in the Roman era, a recruit gladiator is forced to fight for his survival, while the man who is responsible for his entry into the Colosseum, watches from above.

## Game Idea and core mechanics
A top down hack and slash type game. Just like Call of Duty: Zombies, the player will go through waves, with each wave getting harder and harder, introducing new swords, new enemies and more enemies. The player will have a special ability for each sword that they can activate. Swords will also have different abilities that give the player more options on how they approach each wave. After a set amount of waves, the player can go to "town" where they can obtain upgrades. 

## Story
Rumours reached the emperor that a strange man with telekinetic powers has been sighted from several witnesses. These were only rumours, but it would create an audience in the Colosseum, so the emperor decided to capture him and forced him to fight, with no training. As the emperor expected, the Colosseum was full. Although rare, the emperor himself had attended, not because he believed the rumours, but an event such as this could not be missed. The emperor rises from his seat, looks to the crowd, and announces the challenger. The gate rises, the crowd silent and patiently waiting. A steel sword, floating above the ground came out first with the challenger following just behind. The emperor slowly grins, raises his cup and yells “FIGHT!”. 

## Combat mechanics
The sword is constantly floating around the player. Using the arrow keys, determine where the player is attacking. Depending on what sword he has a different ability can be activated. Player can press "Special ability" button that will play an animation. For a standard sword, it will simply go around the player hitting all nearby enemies. Swords spawn randomly in the arena. Each sword has a durability so the player can’t overuse one type of sword except for the standard sword.

Does the player start off with a standard sword? - Yes

~Can the player pick a sword back up once thrown? (Swords only have a few uses then breaks)~
~Maybe the player always has a standard sword that he MUST melee with but once he picks up another sword, the standard sword switches and he can throw or do whatever with the new sword.~

## Types of swords:
* Standard sword, nothing special
* Projectile shooting sword
* Life stealing sword
* Multi-sword (So player can throw up to 10 swords in quick succession)
* Piercing sword (can go through multiple enemies)

## Pixel art canvas size
Arena -  320 x 180 then upscale to 1920 x 1080 
Main character - 25x38
Melee/Ranged enemies - 25x38
Crowd - 16x16 - Maybe bigger then downscale if you want more detail
Final Boss - Bigger then main character and crowd?

## Upgrades, XP, statistics
How will upgrades work?? Buy XP or maybe enemies drop money so the main character can buy upgrades. But if we do upgrades, we will have to figure out how to scale enemies so they become stronger as the main character becomes stronger. We can’t let the player upgrade too quickly so he becomes overpowered and we can’t scale the enemies up too quickly so they become too hard to kill. 
We could keep the standard enemies one hit, but increase the number of them so they become overwhelming. The point of the swords would not be to increase the damage, but to kill multiple enemies at the same time. In later rounds they can become two hits, so not too hard to kill.

* What kind of upgrades would we have?? 
  * More durability on sword
  * Faster swings
  * Movement speed

I think we shouldn’t have stats or XP but instead just stick to upgrades that make the player stronger and helps kill enemies. If this is the case, we should probably stick to the player earning money from the kills. The good upgrades are expensive and we can have starter upgrades that help but are not that good for later rounds.
