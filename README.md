# FightForFreedom---Project
Set in the Roman era, a gladiator is forced to fight for his survival, while the man who is responsible for his entry into the Colosseum, watches from above. Little did they know, 

###### Game Idea and core mechanics
A top down hack and slash type game. Just like Call of Duty: Zombies, the player will go through waves, with each wave getting harder and harder, introducing new swords, new enemies and more enemies. The player can melee enemies OR throw and control the sword he's wielding with the mouse. Swords will also have different abilities that give the player more options on how they approach each wave. After a set amount of waves, the player can go to "town" where they can obtain upgrades. 

###### Story
Main character is captured because of his abilities and the emperor sees him as a threat for the future.

###### Combat mechanics
The player can use swords to melee enemies. His special ability is that he can throw the swords and control them in the air. Depending on what sword he has a different ability can be activated. If the character throws a normal sword, then it can still be controlled, but can only hit the enemy and nothing else. The sword's abilities still work when he melees. Player can move around while controlling the sword that’s already in the air, but cannot attack while his sword is not in his hand. Swords spawn randomly in the arena. Each sword has a durability so the player can’t overuse one type of sword (except standard sword (main character has special bond with the standard sword so he doesn’t want to lose it by throwing it???).

Does the player start off with a standard sword?
Can the player pick a sword back up once thrown? (Swords only have a few uses then breaks)
Maybe the player always has a standard sword that he MUST melee with but once he picks up another sword, the standard sword switches and he can throw or do whatever with the new sword.

###### Types of swords:
Standard sword, nothing special
Projectile shooting sword
Life stealing sword
Multi-sword (So player can throw up to 10 swords in quick succession)
Piercing sword (can go through multiple enemies)

###### Pixel art canvas size
Arena -  320 x 180 then upscale to 1920 x 1080 
Main character - 25x38
Melee/Ranged enemies - 25x38
Crowd - 16x16 - Maybe bigger then downscale if you want more detail
Final Boss - Bigger then main character and crowd?

###### Upgrades, XP, statistics
How will upgrades work?? Buy XP or maybe enemies drop money so the main character can buy upgrades. But if we do upgrades, we will have to figure out how to scale enemies so they become stronger as the main character becomes stronger. We can’t let the player upgrade too quickly so he becomes overpowered and we can’t scale the enemies up too quickly so they become too hard to kill. 
We could keep the standard enemies one hit, but increase the number of them so they become overwhelming. The point of the swords would not be to increase the damage, but to kill multiple enemies at the same time. In later rounds they can become two hits, so not too hard to kill.

What kind of upgrades would we have?? 
*More durability on sword
*Faster swings
*Movement speed

I think we shouldn’t have stats or XP but instead just stick to upgrades that make the player stronger and helps kill enemies. If this is the case, we should probably stick to the player earning money from the kills. The good upgrades are expensive and we can have starter upgrades that help but are not that good for later rounds.
